Automated Waste Disposal System
Overview
The Automated Waste Disposal System is a Python-based solution designed to streamline the process of waste sorting and recycling. It incorporates Quanser Simulation for controlling a Q-arm and Q-bot, as well as an Ultrasonic Sensor for precise object detection.

The system is capable of differentiating bins and identifying exact pick-up and drop-off coordinates for containers. It ensures efficient, autonomous operation, revolutionizing the approach to waste management.

Key Features
Automated Sorting: Differentiates bins and sorts containers into the appropriate recycling bin autonomously.

Coordinate Identification: Utilizes advanced functions to identify pick-up and drop-off locations accurately, ensuring efficient waste disposal.

Q-arm and Q-bot Control: Integrates Quanser Simulation to control these components, vital to the sorting and disposal process.
